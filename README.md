    <h3>The code for the PVP Boys website.</h3>
    <p>02/20/2022:</p>
The basic HTML has been written. I plan to add some CSS soon. I am still new to HTML & CSS so I may not write the most efficent things.

    <p>02/21/2022:</p>
I added CSS for the index page, but forgot to update the index page from my local files to GitHub. So this is a reminder to do that. Memes and Archive pages have been added. CSS has been made for the linkspage plus for the new ones added. Buttons added to switch between the pages. Old style GeoCities icons also added.

I added a better logo at the top of the Index page. I will add for all the other pages soon. I used the Gorillaz font.

    Huge changes. New navigator at top, default HTML buttons removed. The about me section on the index was removed and will be added to it's seperate page, the background color is now gray and just overall the layout of every single part of the site has been moved besides the copyright.
